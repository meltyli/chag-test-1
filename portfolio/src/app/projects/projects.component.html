<p>You must include projects in your portfolios. Employers expect and want to see coding portfolio projects to evaluate
  a developer's work. If you recently graduated from college, you may include projects completed for class, such as a
  thesis project. A coding portfolio should contain 4-10 projects.

  These projects should demonstrate your skills, letting potential employers and recruiters know that you can do what
  your resume suggests. For this reason, it's important that your projects reflect the job you're aiming for.

  For example, if your goal is to work as a front-end web developer, include projects displaying your work on webpages.
  These can come from freelance work, class projects, personal or volunteer projects, and even projects in progress.

  Make sure that you regularly update the projects you feature on your website. Regular updates show a strong work
  ethic. You should also choose projects that highlight the breadth and depth of your coding knowledge.

  While some developers may put screenshots of their work on their website, try to include links to any webpages you've
  worked on. This allows potential employers to get a better look at your work.

  Many coders include links to projects housed on GitHub or other development platforms. Professionals often use GitHub
  to show off current and ongoing projects, and public GitHub profiles allow potential employers to see code updates in
  real time.

  It's good to also add explanations of your role in each project, particularly for projects that involved a team.
  Offering an explanation also allows you to point out specific project details that you want employers to notice and
  explain how you approached the work.</p>
